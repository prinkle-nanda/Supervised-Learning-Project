# Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my PGP in AI & ML from Great Learning. It focuses on implementing various supervised learning algorithms to classify and predict outcomes from structured datasets. The project covers key aspects of data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

# Key Objectives
  * Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
  * Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and apply feature engineering
  * Train and evaluate multiple Supervised Learning models:
      - Decision Trees
      - Random Forest
      - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      - Logistic Regression
  * Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning
  * Compare model performances and derive insights

# Tools & Libraries Used
  * Python (Jupyter Notebook)
  * Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)
  * Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  * Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)

# Analysis Performed
  * Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
  * Feature Engineering & Selection
  * Supervised Learning Model Training & Evaluation
  * Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
  * Comparison of Model Performance
